            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Life on Earth began over 3.5 billion years ago with the formation of simple, single-celled organisms. The early atmosphere was rich in gases like methane and ammonia, which combined to form amino acids, the building blocks of life. Scientists believe that under the influence of lightning and volcanic activity, these molecules assembled into more complex structures, eventually forming the first cells.</p>
            <h2>Formation of Prokaryotic Cells</h2>
            <p>Prokaryotes were the earliest life forms, lacking a defined nucleus but thriving in harsh conditions. These cells used chemosynthesis to obtain energy, allowing them to survive in environments like deep-sea vents. Over time, some prokaryotes developed photosynthesis, which introduced oxygen into the atmosphere, paving the way for more complex organisms.</p>
