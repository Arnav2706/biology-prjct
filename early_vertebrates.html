            <h2>Evolution of Early Vertebrates</h2>
            <p>About 500 million years ago, the first vertebrates appeared. These early fish-like creatures developed a backbone, providing structural support and protection for their nervous system. The evolution of vertebrates allowed for greater mobility and adaptability in different environments.</p>
            
            <h2>Transition to Land</h2>
            <p>The move from water to land was a critical milestone in evolution. The development of limbs and lungs allowed some vertebrates to explore terrestrial environments, leading to the rise of amphibians, reptiles, and eventually mammals.</p>
            
            <h2>Emergence of Hominin Ancestors</h2>
            <p>The lineage leading to humans diverged from other primates around 7 million years ago. Early hominins, like Sahelanthropus, displayed bipedalism, marking the beginning of human evolution. These ancestors laid the groundwork for the development of the genus Homo.</p>
