            <h2>Introduction to Eukaryotic Cells</h2>
            <p>Eukaryotic cells, which emerged around 1.6 to 2 billion years ago, are characterized by their complex structures. Unlike simpler prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and organelles, each with specialized functions. The development of these cells marked a significant step in the evolution of life, allowing for greater complexity and diversity among organisms.</p>
            <p>The theory of endosymbiosis suggests that eukaryotic cells evolved when one prokaryotic cell engulfed another, forming a symbiotic relationship. This process led to the development of mitochondria and chloroplasts, organelles that play crucial roles in energy production and photosynthesis, respectively.</p>
            
            <h2>Significance of Eukaryotic Evolution</h2>
            <p>Eukaryotic cells provided the foundation for all multicellular life forms, including plants, animals, and fungi. The presence of organelles like mitochondria allowed these cells to generate more energy, supporting the development of larger, more complex organisms. Additionally, the genetic diversity facilitated by sexual reproduction in eukaryotes led to rapid evolution and adaptation.</p>
            
            <h2>Impact on Biodiversity</h2>
            <p>The emergence of eukaryotic cells marked a turning point in the history of life on Earth. This complexity enabled organisms to adapt to a wide range of environments, leading to the incredible biodiversity we see today. The rise of eukaryotes also set the stage for the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid diversification that gave rise to many of the major animal groups.</p>
