            <h2>Emergence of Multicellularity</h2>
            <p>About 600 million years ago, the first multicellular organisms emerged, representing a significant leap in complexity. These organisms consisted of groups of cells that worked together, leading to the formation of tissues and organs. This shift allowed organisms to grow larger and adapt to new environments.</p>
            
            <h2>Benefits of Multicellularity</h2>
            <p>Multicellularity brought numerous advantages, such as increased size, specialization of cells, and greater structural complexity. This allowed organisms to develop specialized tissues, such as muscles and nerves, which enabled more efficient movement and responses to environmental stimuli.</p>
            
            <h2>Precambrian Life and Early Animal Forms</h2>
            <p>During the late Precambrian period, the first simple animals began to appear. These early forms laid the groundwork for the incredible diversity of life that would follow in the Cambrian Explosion. Sponges, jellyfish, and other soft-bodied organisms dominated this era, showcasing the early stages of animal evolution.</p>
